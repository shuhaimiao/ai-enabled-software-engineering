# AI-Enabled Software Engineering

A curated collection of resources, articles, research papers, and personal insights on software engineering, with a particular focus on the intersection of artificial intelligence and software development practices.

## Purpose

This repository aims to document and explore the evolving landscape of software engineering, with special attention to how AI is transforming development practices, tools, and methodologies. While AI technologies like large language models, code generation tools, and intelligent assistants are a primary focus, this collection also includes traditional software engineering topics that may be viewed through the lens of AI or stand on their own merit.

## Personal Perspective

This repository is shaped by my personal journey and experiences as a software engineer. The resources, insights, and analyses shared here reflect my professional encounters with both traditional software engineering practices and emerging AI technologies. By documenting my observations, learnings, and occasional struggles, I hope to provide a practical, experience-based perspective that complements more theoretical or academic resources.

The content is inherently subjective and represents my evolving understanding of the field. I believe that personal narratives can offer unique value in a rapidly changing discipline, as they capture the human element of adapting to technological shifts.

## Contents

- **Articles**: Summaries and links to noteworthy publications about software engineering, both AI-specific and traditional
- **Research**: Academic papers and industry research on software development practices and AI integration
- **Tools**: Reviews and comparisons of development tools, including but not limited to AI-powered solutions
- **Case Studies**: Real-world examples of effective software engineering practices and AI integration
- **Thoughts**: Personal reflections and analysis on emerging trends in the broader software engineering discipline

## Why This Matters

Software engineering is continuously evolving, with AI representing one of the most significant catalysts for change in recent years. This repository tracks these developments to help:

- Software engineers adapt to new tools and methodologies, whether AI-powered or not
