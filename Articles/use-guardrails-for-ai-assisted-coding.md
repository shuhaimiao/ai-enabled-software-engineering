## Summary
This article discusses the importance of implementing guardrails when using AI-assisted coding tools like GitHub Copilot. Adam Tornhill argues that while AI coding assistants can significantly boost productivity, they also introduce risks related to code quality, security, and maintainability if used without proper oversight. The article outlines a practical framework for implementing guardrails that allow teams to harness the benefits of AI while mitigating potential risks, including establishing coding standards, implementing automated quality checks, and developing team protocols for AI-generated code review.

## Key Points
- AI coding assistants can boost productivity but may introduce code quality and security risks if used without proper guardrails
- Teams should establish clear coding standards and policies for AI-assisted development, including which parts of the codebase are suitable for AI generation
- Automated quality checks (including static analysis, security scanning, and complexity metrics) are essential to verify AI-generated code
- Code reviews should be adapted for AI-assisted development, with reviewers being particularly vigilant about certain patterns and issues
- Organizations should monitor and measure the impact of AI tools on their codebase over time to identify both benefits and potential issues
