## Summary
This series argues that AI is advancing at a breakneck pace toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence, with profound implications that most people aren't fully comprehending. Aschenbrenner presents a timeline suggesting AGI by 2027 is "strikingly plausible" based on consistent scaling trends in deep learning. The author projects that by 2025/26, AI systems will surpass many college graduates in capability, and by decade's end, will exceed human intelligence. This progression will trigger massive infrastructure investments (trillion-dollar compute clusters), geopolitical competition (particularly with China), and eventually require national security involvement. The series frames this as potentially the most transformative technological advancement in history, with existential implications for humanity.

## Key Points
- The jump from GPT-2 to GPT-4 represented a progression from "preschooler" to "smart high-schooler" level capabilities in just four years, and another similar qualitative jump is projected by 2027
- AI progress can be measured by tracking "OOMs" (Orders of Magnitude/10x improvements) across three key areas: computing power (~0.5 OOMs/year), algorithmic efficiencies (~0.5 OOMs/year), and "unhobbling" gains (removing limitations from AI systems)
- Trillion-dollar investments in computing infrastructure will be necessary, driving unprecedented industrial mobilization and requiring significant increases in electricity production
- The series warns of serious security vulnerabilities at leading AI labs, where secrets that could enable AGI development might be accessible to state actors like China
- Controlling superintelligent systems presents an unsolved technical challenge ("superalignment"), with potential for catastrophic failure if not addressed
- The author anticipates government intervention in AGI development by 2027-2028, moving the final stages of superintelligence development into classified national security projects

## Notes
*To be added after reading*

For more detailed information, the series is divided into several interconnected essays:
- [Introduction](https://situational-awareness.ai/)
- [From GPT-4 to AGI: Counting the OOMs](https://situational-awareness.ai/from-gpt-4-to-agi/)
- Additional essays on superintelligence, trillion-dollar clusters, security, alignment, geopolitical implications, and "The Project" (government involvement)
