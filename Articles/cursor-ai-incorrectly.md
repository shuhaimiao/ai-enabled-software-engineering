## Summary
This article argues that most developers are using Cursor AI inefficiently. Huntley suggests that instead of treating Cursor as a mere IDE or Google replacement, users should build a "stdlib" (standard library) of prompting rules and compose them together like Unix pipes. The article demonstrates how to create and utilize Cursor Rules to automate various development tasks and increase productivity.

## Key Points
- Common mistakes when using Cursor include underspecification of prompts and treating it as an IDE rather than an autonomous agent
- The power of Cursor Rules for automating workflows is being overlooked by most users
- Creating a library of rules that can be composed together dramatically increases productivity
- Examples include automatic license header addition, conventional commit formatting, and specialized development workflows
- Rules can be created that teach Cursor about your specific codebase, leading to increasingly accurate outcomes
